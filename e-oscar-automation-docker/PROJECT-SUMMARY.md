# E-Oscar Dispute Review Automation: Project Summary

## Project Overview

The E-Oscar Dispute Review Automation project addresses the requirement to automate DF's manual dispute review process, which is performed daily and takes approximately 1 hour of developer time. This automation focuses specifically on the "Review and Categorize Disputes" component of the workflow.

## Implementation Approach

We've implemented a Docker-based solution that:

1. Automates the login process to E-Oscar, including OTP handling
2. Retrieves and processes pending disputes
3. Applies business rules to categorize disputes as frivolous or non-frivolous
4. Takes appropriate actions in both E-Oscar and ClickUp based on categorization
5. Provides comprehensive logging and error handling

## Technology Stack

- **Node.js**: Core runtime environment
- **Puppeteer**: Browser automation for E-Oscar interaction
- **Docker**: Containerization for deployment
- **Supabase**: Secure credential and dispute data management
- **Slack API**: OTP retrieval from email forwards
- **ClickUp API**: Task management integration

## Key Features

### Automation Logic

The system implements the exact business logic specified in the requirements:

- **Non-Frivolous** categorization if:
  - Dispute Code 1 or Dispute Code 2 contains "103"
  - Images has any value other than "--" or "0"
  - FCRA Relevant Information has any value other than "--"
- **Frivolous**: All other cases

### Actions Performed

For non-frivolous disputes:
1. Extract the indicator details
2. Add as a comment to the ClickUp ticket
3. Change status to "NEED TO ESCALATE"

For frivolous disputes:
1. Close the case in E-Oscar (click continue 3 times, select "01 - Information accurate as of last submission. No changes." and submit)
2. Close the ClickUp ticket

### Security Considerations

- Credentials stored securely in Supabase
- Non-privileged user for container execution
- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- OTP handling through Slack integration

## Deployment Options

The solution can be deployed in multiple ways:

1. **Docker Containerization**: The recommended approach for production, providing isolation and consistent behavior.
2. **Local Development**: For testing and development purposes.
3. **AWS Remote Desktop**: For deployment on the team's remote AWS desktops.

## Time Savings Analysis

Based on the observed manual process:

- **Manual Process**: ~60 minutes daily
- **Automated Process**: ~5 minutes of setup time daily
- **Daily Time Saved**: ~55 minutes
- **Monthly Time Saved**: ~20 hours
- **Annual Time Saved**: ~240 hours

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Integration Testing**: Test the automation with real E-Oscar credentials in a controlled environment.
2. **User Training**: Brief training session for the team on how to monitor and maintain the automation.
3. **Monitoring Setup**: Configure alerts for failures and performance monitoring.
4. **Password Rotation Handling**: Implement a process for updating credentials when passwords expire.
5. **Future Enhancement**: Consider extending automation to other parts of the workflow, such as dispute data download and ClickUp integration.

## Conclusion

The E-Oscar Dispute Review Automation successfully addresses the requirement to automate the daily dispute review process. By implementing the specified business rules and integrating with the necessary systems, the solution will save approximately 1 hour of developer time each day, while maintaining accuracy and consistency in dispute processing.
